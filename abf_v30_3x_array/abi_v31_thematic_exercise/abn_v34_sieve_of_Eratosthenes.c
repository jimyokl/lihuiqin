// "删除法求质数" in English is "Sieve of Eratosthenes". It refers to 
// an algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit by iteratively 
// marking the multiples of each prime number as composite (i.e., "deleting" them).
//Sieve of Eratosthenes  
// In mathematics, the Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding 
// all prime numbers up to a specified integer. It is the predecessor to the modern Sieve of Atkin, 
// which is faster but more complex. It was created by Eratosthenes, 
// an ancient Greek mathematician. Wheel factorization is often applied on the list of 
// integers to be checked for primality, before Sieve of Eratosthenes is used, to increase the speed.
